<h1>Restaurante!</h1>

An interactive restaurant management system. A user in the normal parties screen can create parties and set the server name, table number and number of guests for that new party. The home screen (along with the rest of screens) allows a user to navigate between the Parties(home), an admin log in, and views for the checks bar and kitchen.

In the individual views for a party a user can order food for that party and see the name of each food item ordered along with the price of those items. The bottom of the screen for each party allows the user to see a current subtotal, tax and grand total.

The kitchen/bar view allows a user to see currently active orders, the time since they have been opened and changes the color of each item depending on those times.

To view all currently open checks or close a check a user can view the checks page. The checks page displays all currently opened checks their items, and totals with suggested gratuities. There is also an option to split a check.
